Project\-: D\-S-\/\-O\-O\-P Project Author\-: Sekou Diaby, Sameer Sapra Date\-: April 18, 2014 Description\-: This program is a menu based system which adds students to a college database. This program more specifically keeps tracks of students in an engineering program. This class contains the menus of the program that will be used to navigate. The purpose of the class is to act as an interfac between the user and the program. The user will only see and used methods from this class. These methods will call other methods in other related classes to perform the desired action of the user. This is the class that will mostly make method calls to validate any input entered by the user. included files disables warnings $<$\#pragma warning used for depricated functions\-::pragma warning(disable\-:4996)
